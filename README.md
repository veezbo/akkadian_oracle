Have you ever visited a museum with an ancient people's exhibit? Surely you've seen the various artifacts that are available. But have you ever stopped to wonder how those people from thousands of years ago really saw the world? It's been impossible to try to even get a sense without being a historian or directly involved in that field- or at least, until now!

**AkkadianOracle** lets you talk to someone from 3000 years ago who lives in Ancient Mesopotamia and now magically speaks English and can communicate with you across time. This is your chance to better understand how Akkadians viewed the world and how their common sense understanding differs from ours.

You can try out the totally free version (requires a free Poe account) based on ChatGPT here:  
https://poe.com/AkkadianOracle

Optionally, there is a version for Poe subscribers based on GPT-4 here:  
https://poe.com/AkkadianArchon

## Sample Chats
Here are some insightful conversations:

- Crime and Punishment: https://poe.com/s/5qSftTCZoQysXUjQw0vh
- Morality and Virtuousness: https://poe.com/s/9LwPZWpbsSM7WPw9jMHl
- Labor and Organization of Society: https://poe.com/s/x56WImkBveeOD09JUqgE

Please send over any that you had that you particularly found insightful!

## Implementation Details
**AkkadianOracle** is a chatbot built using the Poe platform on top of ChatGPT and GPT-4 with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with my released [Akkadian English corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/veezbo/akkadian_english_corpus) [2].

In this repo, these are the relevant files and their descriptions:
- `main.py` is the app code that can be deployed to Modal using `modal deploy main.py`
- `akkadian_talker_bot.py` implements the methods required by the [Poe Fastapi protocol](https://github.com/poe-platform/fastapi_poe)
- `corpus.py` loads the HuggingFace dataset into memory, and additionally implements the retrieval part of RAG, retrieving the most relevant sentences from the corpus based on the user's question
- `prompt.py` assembles the prompt for the LLM based on the relevant context and user question

Implementation of chatbot built on Poe that lets you communicate with someone from 3000 years ago in Ancient Mesopotamia. How does their common sense understanding and worldview differ from yours?

## Alternative Approaches
The overall goal of this project is to create a realistic chatbot that can communicate as if is someone with knowledge of Akkadian language, sensibilities, and culture all latent within a textual corpus. 

The RAG-based approach used for AkkadianOracle is the best approach so far. An alternative approach which has not worked so well is attempting to fine-tune smaller LLMs using the same corpus. This fine-tuning was attempted both on all paramters, and with [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) [5]. The notebooks for both are shared in this repo.

It is not known whether PEFTing big LLMs (say, at the scale of ChatGPT) will work. It seems plausible it would, but it is rather difficult to test due to the scale.

It is likely that full-parameter fine-tuning of big LLMs would work, provided the learning rate is picked appropriately, simply due to the fact that this would be roughly equivalent to continuing training of the original model. However, this would require an inordinate amount of resources.

## Future Work
Future work will involve field-testing these bots on their performance. Assyriologists can help provide qualitative feedback (on tone, conversability, and usefulness in research), and we can measure quantiative results by re-purposing/building examinations on the Neo-Assyrian period these bots are trained on.

Because LLMs are motivated liars, it is also important to require citations for at least the falsifiable claims that are made. As a first step, we could adjust the prompt so that relevant citations from the RAG context are provided.
